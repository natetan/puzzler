# Puzzler
## This website allows the user to play a game of 15 puzzle

### Sramble, then fill the slots back in their right order

### Strategy
- Line the left side vertically first (1, 5, 9, 13)
   - Last two slots should follow each other in reverse order to make it easier to slot in
- Line the top horizontally (1, 2, 3, 4)
   - Same concept as the last step for slotting
- Repeat this process: left side, then top

### Notes
- Tiles that can be moved will glow red when hovered over
- This was one of the homework assignments for a web class
- ```.editorconfig``` makes Github code viewing of tab size 4
- JavaScript Heavy
